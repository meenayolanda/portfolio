     <p> Hi, I’m Meena, and I’m a teenage social activist and journalist. I’m also a champion Snapchatter, but if you’re here for that, I’m afraid you’ve come to the wrong place. I was born in New Orleans, moved to London at age seven, then returned to the States to live in Austin, Texas at the age of fourteen. I love to travel, and so far I’ve been to: Germany, Wales, France, Spain, Belgium, Austria, the Netherlands, both sides of Cyprus, Morocco, and the Dominican Republic. On this website, I post about my experiences with the Girls Who Code program and my articles from the school paper.</p>
